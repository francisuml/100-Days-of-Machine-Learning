# 📌 Day 2: NumPy for Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
Welcome to **Day 2** of our **100-day Machine Learning journey**! Today, we dive into **NumPy**, a fundamental Python library for numerical computing. We explore its applications in handling arrays and manipulating images as **NumPy ndarrays**.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays
  - 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Image processing with NumPy
  - Converting an image to grayscale
  - Flipping an image (horizontal/vertical)
  - Rotating an image
  - Inverting colors
- Visualizing images with Matplotlib

## 🎯 Goals
✅ Understand the **basics of NumPy arrays**
✅ Learn to **manipulate images as NumPy ndarrays**
✅ Perform **image transformations** using NumPy
✅ Use **Matplotlib to plot images**

## 📝 Challenges Completed
- Created **1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy arrays**
- Manipulated an **image as a NumPy ndarray**
- Converted an image to **grayscale**
- Flipped the image **horizontally and vertically**
- Rotated the image **by 90 degrees**
- Inverted the **color of the image**
- Plotted the **original and transformed images** using `matplotlib.pyplot`
