# ðŸš€ 100-Day Machine Learning Project

## ðŸ“– Overview
Welcome to the **100-Day Machine Learning Project**! This journey is designed to take you from the fundamentals of Machine Learning to advanced techniques, tackling **real-world industry problems** along the way. Each day, we focus on a specific topic, completing hands-on coding exercises, building projects, and developing a **machine learning portfolio**.

## ðŸ“… Progress
| Day | Topic | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1  | Introduction to ML | Understanding ML concepts, types, and applications |
| 2  | NumPy | Mastering arrays, image manipulation, and basic computations |
| 3  | Pandas | Data manipulation, filtering, and analysis with Pandas |
| 4  | Data Visualization | Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data insights |
| 5  | Data Preprocessing | Handling missing values, encoding, and normalizing data |
| 6  | Probabilities and Statistics |Understanding mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and probability distributions |
| 7  | Linear Algebra in ML | Vectors, matrices, dot products, eigenvalues, and transformations |
| 8  | Gradient Descent | Compute the gradient (derivative) of the cost function, Update parameters|
| 9  | Cost Functions & Loss Functions in Machine Learning| Understanding Cost & Loss Functions, Mathematical Formula |
| 10 | Evaluating Machine Learning Models | Accuracy, Precision, F1-Score, ROC curve|
| 11 | Machine Learning Work Flow| Understanding the ML Workflow|
| 12 | Supervised Learning | What is Supervised Learning|

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
