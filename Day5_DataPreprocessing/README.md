# 📅 Day 5: Data Preprocessing

## 🚀 Overview
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in Machine Learning. Today, we will explore techniques to clean and prepare raw data for ML models.

## 📊 Dataset
We will use the **apps.csv**.

## 📝 Instructions
- Load the dataset and inspect the structure.
- Apply each preprocessing technique step by step.
- Visualize the impact of preprocessing on data distribution.
- Save the preprocessed dataset for ML modeling.

## 🏁 Goal
By the end of the day, you will have a well-prepared dataset ready for machine learning models!
