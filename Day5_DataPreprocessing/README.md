# 📅 Day 5: Data Preprocessing

## 🚀 Overview
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in Machine Learning. Today, we will explore techniques to clean and prepare raw data for ML models.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalization and standardization
- Removing duplicates and outliers
- Data transformation techniques

## 🏆 Challenges
1. Identify missing values and fill them using appropriate strategies.
2. Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding.
3. Normalize and standardize numerical data.
4. Remove duplicate entries from the dataset.
5. Detect and handle outliers using statistical methods.
6. Transform skewed data for better model performance.
7. Apply feature scaling techniques.
8. Handle imbalanced data using resampling methods.
9. Convert date-time values into meaningful features.
10. Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
We will use the **Google Play Store Apps Dataset** from Kaggle.

## 📝 Instructions
- Load the dataset and inspect the structure.
- Apply each preprocessing technique step by step.
- Visualize the impact of preprocessing on data distribution.
- Save the preprocessed dataset for ML modeling.

## 🏁 Goal
By the end of the day, you will have a well-prepared dataset ready for machine learning models!
