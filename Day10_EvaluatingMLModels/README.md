# Day 10 - Evaluating Machine Learning Models

## **Objective**
The objective of this project is to evaluate machine learning models using key performance metrics: **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC curve**. The goal is to assess classification performance effectively and make informed decisions about model selection and optimization.

## **Why Do We Need to Evaluate ML Models?**
Machine learning models must be evaluated to ensure they perform well on unseen data. Proper evaluation helps us:
- Measure model effectiveness objectively.
- Compare different models for a given problem.
- Detect overfitting or underfitting.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
- Ensure reliability and robustness in real-world applications.

## **Why Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the ROC Curve?**
Each metric provides unique insights:
- **Accuracy** – Measures overall correctness but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets.
- **Precision** – Important when false positives must be minimized (e.g., spam detection, medical diagnosis).
- **Recall** – Crucial when false negatives are costly (e.g., fraud detection, cancer diagnosis).
- **F1-Score** – A balanced measure that combines precision and recall.
- **ROC Curve & AUC** – Helps visualize model performance at different classification thresholds.

## **Dataset**
We will generate a **synthetic dataset** for binary classification with numerical features and a target variable (0 or 1). This dataset is suitable for evaluating classification models.

## **Project Steps**
1. **Dataset Creation** – Generate a balanced dataset with numerical features.
2. **Model Training** – Train different classifiers:
   - Random Forest
3. **Evaluation Metrics** – Compute accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and plot the ROC curve.
4. **Visualizations** – Use **Plotly** to create interactive **2D & 3D visualizations** of model performance.
