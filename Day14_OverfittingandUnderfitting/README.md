# Day 14: Understanding Overfitting & Underfitting in Simple Terms

## 🚀 Objective
In this session, we explore two fundamental problems in machine learning: **overfitting** and **underfitting**. We will:
- Define and understand **overfitting** and **underfitting**.
- Learn how to identify these issues in models.
- Explore techniques to mitigate these problems using **regularization (L1, L2, Dropout)**.
- Apply these concepts to a real-world dataset.
- Use visualizations to clearly demonstrate these issues.

## 🧠 What is Overfitting & Underfitting?

### 🎯 Underfitting (High Bias)
- Happens when a model is **too simple** and fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data.
- Leads to **high training and testing errors**.
- Example: A straight-line model trying to fit complex data.

### 🎯 Overfitting (High Variance)
- Happens when a model is **too complex** and captures noise rather than the actual pattern.
- **Very low training error but high testing error**.
- Example: A model memorizing training data instead of learning a general pattern.

## 🛠 How Do We Fix Overfitting & Underfitting?
We can apply **regularization techniques** to balance bias and variance:
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)**: Encourages sparsity by reducing less important features.
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)**: Shrinks coefficients to prevent over-reliance on certain features.
- **Dropout (for Neural Networks)**: Randomly disables neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

## 📊 Real-World Dataset & Experiment
We apply these concepts to a dataset where we:
1. Train a **Linear Regression model** (baseline).
2. Introduce **Decision Tree Regression** to demonstrate **overfitting**.
3. Apply **Ridge & Lasso Regression** to control overfitting.
4. Evaluate models using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
5. Visualize model performance using **robust plots**.

## 🏆 Key Takeaways
- **Underfitting:** Model is too simple → Poor training & testing performance.
- **Overfitting:** Model is too complex → Great training performance but poor testing performance.
- **Solution:** Use **regularization (L1, L2, Dropout), pruning (Decision Trees), and cross-validation**.

## 🔥 Motivation for the Next Topic
Great! Now that we understand **overfitting & underfitting**, let’s move forward and tackle a crucial question:

➡️ **"How do we work with real-world datasets?"** 🤔

In **Day 15**, we’ll explore:
- How to handle **real, messy datasets**.
- Techniques for **data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- How to prepare datasets for building effective machine learning models.

📌 Stay tuned for an exciting deep dive into real-world data challenges! 🚀
