# Day 12: Supervised Learning

### Objective

Supervised learning is a fundamental machine learning approach where models learn from labeled data. In this session, we explored both regression and classification techniques, applied them to a real-world dataset, and visualized the results in 3D.

Topics Covered

What is Supervised Learning?

Learning from labeled data (input-output pairs)

### Two main types: Regression and Classification

### Regression Analysis

Predicting continuous values

Evaluating using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared

### Classification Analysis

Predicting categorical outcomes

Evaluating using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

### Dataset Used

Selected a real-world dataset suitable for both regression and classification tasks

### Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, normalization, and feature encoding

### Model Implementation

Built regression and classification models using Scikit-Learn

Tuned hyperparameters for better performance

### Visualization

Generated enhanced 3D visualizations using Plotly to illustrate results clearly

### Challenges Faced

Handling imbalanced data in classification

Selecting optimal features for regression

Enhancing 3D visualizations for better interpretability

### Key Learnings

Supervised learning models rely on high-quality labeled data.

Choosing the right evaluation metrics is essential for assessing model performance.

Visualizing results in 3D helps in understanding model behavior.
