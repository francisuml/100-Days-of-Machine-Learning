# Day 7: Linear Algebra in Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Linear Algebra is a fundamental part of Machine Learning. This day covers key concepts such as:
- **Vectors**: Representing data points or features in space.
- **Matrices**: Organizing data and performing transformations.
- **Dot Products**: Measuring similarity between vectors.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Understanding matrix properties and transformations.
- **Practical ML Applications**: Applying these concepts to real-world ML problems.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
We are using a structured dataset that allows us to apply Linear Algebra principles in a meaningful way. The dataset contains multiple numerical features, making it ideal for vectorized operations and transformations.

## ðŸ”¥ Challenges
1. Perform vector operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication).
2. Represent features as vectors and analyze relationships.
3. Apply matrix operations (multiplication, transposition, inversion).
4. Compute dot products to measure feature similarity.
5. Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
6. Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
7. Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using matrix decompositions.
8. Solve a system of linear equations using matrices.
9. Visualize high-dimensional data using linear algebra techniques.
10. Apply linear algebra concepts to a real ML problem.

## ðŸ“œ Learning Outcome
- Gain hands-on experience with vector and matrix operations.
- Understand how these concepts apply to machine learning models.
- Build a foundation for more advanced topics like PCA and SVD.
