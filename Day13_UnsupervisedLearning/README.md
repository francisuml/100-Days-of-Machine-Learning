# Day 13: Unsupervised Learning

ðŸš€ Objective

Today, we explored Unsupervised Learning, a powerful machine learning technique used to uncover hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs. Unlike supervised learning, where we train models with input-output pairs, unsupervised learning finds structure in the data itself.
We applied clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze real-world data, grouping similar entities and reducing the dataset's complexity for better visualization and interpretation.
ðŸ“Œ What We Did

Clustering with K-Means & DBSCAN: We grouped data points based on similarities, allowing us to identify meaningful clusters in the dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: We reduced the number of features while preserving important patterns, making it easier to visualize the dataset in 2D and 3D.
Robust Visualizations: We used Plotly to create interactive plots, helping us understand how data points are distributed and clustered.
Real-World Application: We applied these techniques to a dataset that contains socio-economic and health indicators for various countries, demonstrating how unsupervised learning can be used for pattern discovery.
ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters

Unsupervised learning is a crucial tool in machine learning, enabling us to:
âœ… Discover natural groupings in data (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection).
âœ… Reduce complexity while maintaining meaningful information.
âœ… Find insights in unstructured datasets where labels are not available.
Mastering unsupervised learning is a stepping stone to more advanced AI applications, such as anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and deep learning autoencoders.
ðŸ›  Challenges Faced & How We Overcame Them

Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters: We used the Elbow Method to determine the best number of clusters in K-Means.
Interpreting Clusters Meaningfully: We analyzed feature importance to understand the differences between clusters.
Handling High-Dimensional Data: We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize high-dimensional data effectively.
