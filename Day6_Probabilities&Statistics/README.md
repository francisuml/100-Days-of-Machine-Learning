# 📊 Day 6: Probability & Statistics

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand core statistical concepts: Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- Learn probability basics, including conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem.
- Explore probability distributions: Normal, Binomial, Poisson.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Google Play Store Apps** dataset.
- Visualize statistical data distributions.

## 🏆 Challenges
1. Compute the **mean, median, variance, and standard deviation** of app ratings.
2. Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
3. Convert categorical variables into numerical format.
4. Create a histogram showing the distribution of ratings.
5. Generate a probability density function (PDF) for app ratings.
6. Calculate the probability of an app having a rating **greater than 4.5**.
7. Apply **Bayes' theorem** to determine the likelihood of an app category given a high rating.
8. Explore the impact of sample size on statistical measurements.
9. Simulate a **binomial probability distribution** for app downloads.
10. Analyze and interpret a **Poisson distribution** related to app installs.

## 📈 Visualizations
- Histogram of app ratings.
- Normal probability distribution curve for ratings.
- Probability of app categories based on ratings.
- Binomial and Poisson distribution graphs.
